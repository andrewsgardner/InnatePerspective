# InnatePerspective

When finished, InnatePerspective will be a responsive WordPress theme ideal for musicians or journalists. Its charm lies in having a partially translucent header that displays page content as users scroll or swipe up.

This theme will help facilitate the promotion and presentation of digital media assets. Its design is still under development and the current release shouldn't be used in production environments.
